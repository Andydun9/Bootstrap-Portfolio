    <p>My name is Thomas Duncan, I also go by the name of Andy. I was born and raised in Boise, Idaho. At the age of 19 I joined the United States Coast Guard. I spent 5 years on active duty. During my time of duty, I was stationed on 210-foot cutter (USCGC Active) located out of Port Angeles Washington. I was also stationed Petaluma, California and worked in Supply. After leaving the military, I went back to College and received a Bachelors in Business Management from Golden Gate University. I am Currently residing in Gilbert Arizona and work as Business Analyst for P&amp;C Underwriting. During my time with State Farm I have specialized in building marketing content for an in-house website. </p>

        <p>On my spare time, I enjoy hiking, golfing and hanging out with friends. When I can make it to the snow I also enjoy snowboarding and skiing. I also have picked up the new hobby of brewing beer. My favorite beer that I have brewed so far have been Kolsch. I have also been spending the past 6 months trying to learn to code and build websites. I am currently enrolled in a boot camp to better fine-tune my coding skills.  </p>
